This repository contains the implementation of TREAT-Net, a framework that integrates echocardiography video embeddings with clinical tabular data to predict treatment strategies for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients. The model combines cross-attention fusion and late fusion to capture complementary information, improving robustness and labeled data efficiency.
